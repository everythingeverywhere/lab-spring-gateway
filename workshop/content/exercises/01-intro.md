#### Building a Gateway
This guide walks you through getting started with the Spring Cloud Gateway.

#### Workshop Terminals
Two terminals are included in this workshop. One terminal to be used to run a server and the other to execute commands and to interact with the server in the first terminal.

#### Workshop Code Editor
The workshop features a built in code editor you can use by pressing the `Editor` tab button. Pressing the refresh button in the workshop's UI can help the editor load in switching tabs. The files in this editor automatically save, if you restart the workshop you could loose your progress.

### Environment Build Tools
You can build your app with `Maven` and `Gradle` as they are both included in the environment. Although, only the `Maven` commands are in the workshop for brevity, you can use `Gradle` on your own if you prefer. 

#### Workshop Command Execution
You may progress through the workshop by executing commands by clicking the running man on the commands, they are configured to run in the appropriate terminals. Try this when you clone the GitHub repo in the next step.
