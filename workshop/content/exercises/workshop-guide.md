#### Workshop Terminals
Two terminals are included in this workshop, one terminal is used to run a server and the other terminal to interact with the server and also to execute commands.

#### Workshop Code Editor
The workshop features a built in code editor you can use by pressing the `Editor` tab button. Pressing the refresh button in the workshop's UI can help the editor load when switching tabs. The files in this editor automatically save.

### Environment Build Tools
You can build your app with `Maven` and `Gradle` as they are both included in the environment. Only the `Maven` commands are in the workshop for brevity, but you can use `Gradle` on your own if you prefer. 

#### Workshop Command Execution
To progress through the workshop you execute commands by clicking the running man on the commands in the text, they are configured to run in the appropriate terminals. Try this when you clone the GitHub repo in the next step.
